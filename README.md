# Quizing : Quiz App
## Inspiration
I have experienced, that most of the Quiz apps we use in our school/colleges don't immediately tell whether the chosen option is correct or not, neither they are responsive or have good UI. 

## What it does
Quiz app that is responsive as well as tells if the chosen option is correct and levels up your knowledge.

## How we built it
It is built using HTML,CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript.

## Challenges we ran into
This is my first JS project I ran into many problems like checking if the answer is the same as that of the correct answer or not, and how to save the user's  High score even if the page is refreshed.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I like how I completed my project.

## What we learned
I have learned JS and its integration with CSS.

## What's next for Quizing: Quiz App
I will add a meme feature after every selected answer, as well as an option to choose an answer with audio-only using ALAN.
